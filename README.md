## Introduction

The Car Price Prediction project aims to develop a model that can accurately predict the prices of cars based on features such as make, model, year, mileage, and more. This project utilizes various machine learning techniques to build and evaluate the predictive model.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project contains information about various cars, including features that influence their prices. The dataset is preprocessed and cleaned before being used for model training.

## Installation

To run this project locally, you will need to have Python and Jupyter Notebook installed. Follow the steps below to set up the environment:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Schwarz18/Car-Price-Prediction.git
    cd Car-Price-Prediction
    ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Dependencies

The following libraries are required to run the notebook:

- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn
- jupyter

These dependencies can be installed using the following command:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn jupyter
```

## Usage

To run the Jupyter Notebook and explore the project, follow these steps:

1. Activate the virtual environment (if not already activated):
    ```bash
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

2. Start Jupyter Notebook:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```

3. Open the `Final_Project.ipynb` file and run the cells to execute the code.

## Model

The project explores various machine learning models, including linear regression, decision trees, and random forests. Feature selection, hyperparameter tuning, and model evaluation are performed to identify the best model for predicting car prices.

## Results

The results section includes an analysis of the model performance, including metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared (RÂ²). Visualizations of the predicted vs. actual prices are also provided.
